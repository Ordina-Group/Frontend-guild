- Poll results look good, couple of surprises but hard to explain why.
- For the content calendar:
  - June: PWA / Mobile (Flutter, Rogier)
  - July: React
  - Augustus: Holiday? TypeScript
  - September: TypeScript,
  - Some worries if July/Augustus would be bad for meetups cause of vacations. Maybe focus on blogs/articles/video content (not live?)
